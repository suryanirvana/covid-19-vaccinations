## The COVID-19 Vaccines And Its Progress
### COSC3000 - Visualization and Data Analysis Project
It has been several months now since the first COVID-19 virus vaccine first used. Since then, several questions have surfaced throughout the days, such as:
- What is the current progress of total vaccinations and people who have been both vaccinated and fully vaccinated in each country worldwide?
- How many doses of vaccines were given to the people in each country worldwide?
- What are the rates and the trends of daily vaccination worldwide?
- How many kinds of vaccines for the COVID-19 virus currently exist today worldwide, and which country uses which vaccines?
- On average, how many types of vaccines used for each country worldwide?

The main objective of this project is to explore, highlight patterns and trends, and present the data in a visualized form that is targeted towards everyone in the world. The trends can be helpful as it shows the insights of the current vaccination progress as well as the vaccines used in each country between December 2020-April 2021. It is also useful to predict the number of total vaccinations, people who have been vaccinated and fully vaccinated based on daily basis. It creates more awareness for people to be more prepared to handle this pandemic.

The project is mainly done using Tableau, Tableau Prep, and Python with extra help from some libraries such as pandas and BeautifulSoup. The reason being the familiarity compared to other tools, and also Tableau is the perfect software for data analysis and visualization. Tableau Prep is very useful to clean and preprocess the data. On the other hand, Python is helpful for web scraping, which will be explained in the report. Visualization techniques that are used for the project will be discussed throughout the report.
